## Description

A Visual Studio extension that adds a right-click context menu (on the solution explorer node, specifically) command that allows you to open the the cooresponding Git repository directly in the GitKraken Client.  More features to come! :)

## Prerequisite

In order to use this extension, you must have Visual Studio 2022, as well as the GitKraken Client installed.

You can [download the GitKraken Client for free](https://www.gitkraken.com).

## Solution Explorer

You can open any git repository associated with the solution in the GitKraken Client by simply right-clicking it in Solution Explorer and select Open in Notepad++.

## Settings

The extension will automatically find GitKraken's `Update.exe` when it's located at in the default install directory. If it's installed in a custom location, you can easily change it in the settings dialog.
